B3Dexport.py 3.2.1 - a blender 2.79 .b3d export script - for OpenB3D/Blitz3D/MiniB3D.

License: gpl-2.0

Basically the same as the MineTest version but just with "Export Textures" enabled by default, as well as a few bugfixes. Such as:  
* Fixed an overflow array issue when exported .B3D models are loaded in OpenB3D/MiniB3D.  
* Fixed Textures/Animations not exporting properly if left in Edit Mode.
